A Better Wiki
=============

TODO
----

* finish this README
* write some code

WHAT
----

* avoid being modal: no separation between view & edit
* avoid useless UI: no save button. see google docs save + history
* the user is distilling knowledge, help him not get distracted..
* heavy on search, light on hierarchy: an orphan page is just as good

HOW
---

* file based, sql or nosql?
* distributed or centralized?
* on my own or gain some steam?
