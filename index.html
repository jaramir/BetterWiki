        <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it 
        has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for 
        murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, 
        I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that 
        seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we 
        took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow 
        that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it 
        doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>
        <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to 
        bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. 
        That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same 
        way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our 
        lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you 
        and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>
